# Co-occurrence Patterns and Richness Spatial Patterns in Marine Habitats: Insights from Large-Scale Modelling

## Préambule {.unnumbered #preambule-chapter3}

Grâce au Chapitre 2, nous avons identifié différents états d'habitats biogéniques à l'échelle mondiale en utilisant des données d'un programme de sciences participatives. Ceci est une étape préalable à leur modélisation par la méthode agréger d'abord, prédire ensuite suggérée par @Ferrier_2006. Dans ce chapitre, nous souhaitons modéliser la distribution de ces habitats à l'aide d'une approche SDM. L'objectif est de comprendre les facteurs environnementaux et anthropiques influençant leur occurrence. En caractérisant les niches environnementales, nous pourrions déterminer les habitats qui ont des niches similaires et qui peuvent coexister. Ceci permettrait d'identifier les zones à risque de changements d'état. Une telle identification nous aiderait à mieux comprendre la structuration des écosystèmes côtiers par les habitats biogéniques. Dans ce contexte, ce chapitre vise à étudier la distribution de 13 états d'habitats biogéniques et d'un substrat sur les côtes australiennes.

En résumé, nous avons utilisé un *SDM* de type *Random Forest* multivarié pour caractériser les niches environnementales de ces états d'habitats en nous appuyant sur les données environnementales de Bio-Oracle, ainsi que les pressions anthropiques de la base de données Ocean Health Index. Nos résultats indiquent que le modèle de Random Forest utilisé ici avait un bon pouvoir explicatif, mais présentait un pouvoir prédictif faible, laissant penser que la transférabilité de notre modèle et l'extrapolation seraient difficiles. Nos résultats indiquent que les facteurs les plus importants régissant la distribution de ces différents états d'habitats sont la température de surface de l'eau, l'intensité de la pression de pêche et les anomalies dans la fréquence des vagues de chaleur marine. Nous avons démontré dans ce travail de recherche que tous les états ne pouvaient co-exister au même endroit et suggèrent que certaines combinaisons d'états d'habitats ne sont pas possibles. Ce travail a permis également de mettre en avant que les zones de transitions tempérées/tropicales semblent plus susceptibles à abriter un nombre d'états d'habitats différent, suggérant que de nombreux états d'habitats peuvent trouver des conditions favorables à ce développement. Cela rend ces zones particulièrement susceptibles au changement de régime, puisque la disparition de l'état dominant actuel pourrait laisser place au développement d'un état d'habitat non désiré. En conclusion, ce travail de recherche nous a permis de mettre en évidence les zones et les conditions environnementales plus prône au changement d'états, ce qui a un intérêt pour les gestionnaires pour assurer la pérennité des écosystèmes et des communautés associées à ces états d'habitats.

## Abstract {#abstract-chapt3}

Benthic reef habitats serve as foundational structures in coastal ecosystems, facilitating essential ecological processes and significantly amplifying biodiversity. However they are increasingly subject to regime shifts that can be detrimental for marine ecosystem functioning and biodiversity. In this study we aim to investigate the distribution and ecological drivers of reef benthic habitat states across Australia, in order to understand and anticipate their potential/risk of ecological regime shifts in the face of changing environments and anthropogenic impacts. Using random forest models applied to occurrences of reef habitat states stemming from a previous analyses of the *Reef Life Survey* transect data, we quantified the relative contribution of anthropogenic and environmental drivers in explaining their spatial distribution. Specifically, we focused on 14 reef states including turf, kelp or coral reefs. Models showed a good explanatory power with AUC (mean = 0.87; sd = 0.07). For most habitats, we found that SST, Fishing intensity and Marine Heatwaves were the most important driver of their distribution while anthropogenic factors only had a marginal influence. However, models presented a poor predictive power suggesting limited transferability in time or space. On the calibration areas, we found that several habitats (up to eight) can occur under similar environmental conditions, suggesting that the likelihood of state changes (including regime shifts) is spatially variable. Overall, this approach makes it possible to highlight areas and environmental conditions where the occurrence of alternative stable states is more likely.

## Introduction {#intro-chapt3}

Regime shifts are persistent changes in the structure and/or the function of ecosystems occurring more or less suddenly [@Scheffer_2001 ; @Scheffer_2003]. Ecological regime shifts have been identified in many different ecosystems: forest to savannahs [@Staver_2011], tundra to boreal forests [@Scheffer_2012], coral reefs to macroalgae dominated reefs [@McManus_2004], or fisheries collapse [@Gardmark_2015]. Areas affected by regime shifts tend usually display profound and lasting changes in the ecosystem services they provide to human populations [@Rocha_2015a], with economic impacts through the disappearance of certain activities [@Crepin_2012], and societal and cultural impacts through the loss of cultural and traditional knowledge [@Mustonen_2021]. Thus, one of the common features of all these regime shifts is that they drive the ecosystem under consideration towards a new state, considered from a human perspective to be less desirable [@Scheffer_2009bk].

Multiple factors can trigger a change in ecological regime towards a new ecosystem states [@Rocha_2015b]. These factors include climatic variations caused by global climate change [@Rocha_2015b], increase in the number of extreme climatic events [@Wernberg_2016], introduction of invasive species [@Kotta_2018], increase in anthropogenic pressure [@Halpern_2019], and loss of biogenic habitats [@Airoldi_2008].
 
Biogenic habitats, formed by engineers’ species, play a crucial role in the functioning of marine coastal ecosystems and in supporting components of biodiversity [@Vozzo_2023 ; @Albertson_2022]. For instance, mangroves serve as a nursery for coral-reef fish [@Nagelkerken_2002], coral act as a refuge from predators for many fish and invertebrates species [@Almany_2004], marine seagrasses enhance water quality by for instance increasing water pH [@Ricart_2021], and their presence increases infauna diversity [@Gonzalez-Ortiz_2016 ; @Boye_2017]. Because biogenic habitats are also vulnerable to human pressures and natural disturbances [@Airoldi_2007 ; @Butt_2022 ; @Wernberg_2023], they play a central role in mediating the effects of current environmental changes on marine coastal ecosystems and biodiversity [@Sunday_2017 ; @Bulleri_2018].

Over the last few decades, regime shifts involving persistent changes in biogenic benthic habitats have been observed worldwide across temperate and tropical regions. Examples include shifts from macroalgal forests to either sea urchin barrens [@Ling_2015] or turf [@Filbee-Dexter_2018], from crustose coralline algae to turf [@Cornwall_2023], and also from coral-dominated reefs to macroalgae [@McManus_2004], or from seagrass to bare sediments [@Maxwell_2017]. These regime shifts share in common that as the biogenic habitats degrade or change, novel ecological dynamics take root to push and maintain the ecosystems into new states [@Nystrom_2012]. As these new states are often undesirable from a management perspective while also displaying hysteresis making it difficult to return to the initial state [@Nystrom_2012], substantial efforts have been devoted to identifying, predicting and preventing regime shifts before they occur [@Biggs_2009]. Detection of early warning signals of regime shifts has been intensively investigated by analysing temporal ecosystem dynamics when long-term time series are available [@Scheffer_2009], or spatial patterns emerging from ecological dynamics [@Kefi_2014 ; @Nijp_2019 ; @Ward_2018]. Although promising theoretically based on numerical or mesocosm experiments, these data-greedy methods remain of limited practical interest in real world ecosystems across large spatial scales , as (i) they are often computed retrospectively after the shift has occurred  (e.g. @Litzow_2014) and (ii) to date, no single metrics amongst the alternative candidates (e.g. increasing variance, skewness, etc…) has proven reliable across all case studies [@Hastings_2010]. An alternative that has gained increasing interests is to identify the environmental thresholds beyond which ecosystems shift to new states [@Kelly_2015]. However, this approach has also proved challenging [@Turner_2020 ; @Hillebrand_2020]. Process-based simulation models can for instance contribute to estimating ecological thresholds and informing effective management strategies [@Marzloff_2013 ; @Marzloff_2016] but they remain restricted to theoretical cases or data-rich ecosystems. Overall, different strategies may be necessary to anticipate regime shifts across ecosystems, depending on data availability and ecosystem properties (e.g. non-linear responses, lags in response to effects of stressors ; @Litzow_2016 ; @Turner_2020).

In the case of coral reefs, defining and modelling the occurrence of alternative reef states have improved our understanding and ability to predict the impact of anthropogenic pressures on reef states [@Jouffray_2015 ; @Jouffray_2019 ; @Donovan_2018]. After identifying potential reef states (e.g. @Donovan_2018 ; Chapitre 2), modelling their spatial distribution can indeed help assess the relative importance of different environmental drivers (including climate-driven or local anthropogenic pressures), evaluate the extent to which drivers have synergistic or antagonistic effects on ecosystem states, and also characterise potential non-linear ecosystem responses across environmental gradients [@Jouffray_2015 ; @Jouffray_2019]. All these elements are key to guide anticipatory strategies and define management actions [@Litzow_2016b ; @Turner_2020]. An unexplored avenue concerns the potential for distribution models to identify areas where multiple ecosystem states are possible and hence, where supposedly changes in ecosystem states are more likely. To date however, such modelling strategy has only been led on coral reefs at a local scale [@Jouffray_2019] so its transposability to other ecosystems across larger areas remains untested.

In this context, Chapter 2 defined habitat states based on the *Reef Life Survey* (*RLS*) data, a coherent state that provides a strong ecological basis for conducting a larger-scale exercise a frame. Building on the dataset of reef states occurrences around Australia consolidated in Chapter 2, this study aims to explain and predict their distribution using SDM approaches, with the specific goals of (1) assessing the influence of biophysical factors and anthropogenic pressures on the occurrence of the different reef habitat states, (2) determining the transferability of these SDMs in order to quantify the predictability of reef habitat states at large scales, (3) identify reef states that share similar environmental niches and can potentially coexist, and (4) identify areasthat may host several states, as these areas are the most likely to undergo state changes.

## Materials & Methods {#mat-met-chapt3}

## Datasets

### Biotic dataset

In this study, we used the dataset produced in Chapter 2 from the *RLS* citizen science program where 50-m diver transects were classified into different habitat states based on percentage cover estimates of major benthic habitat groups. As a reminder of Chapter 2, we used a clustering pipeline composed of two distinct algorithm *UMAP* [@McInnes_2020] for dimension reduction and *HDBSCAN* [@Moulavi_2014 ; @McInnes2017] to classify the *RLS* benthic habitat relative cover (estimated through underwater dives; for further details see @Edgar_2014) for 6,554 transects into 17 distinct states. These 17 reef states include iconic biogenic habitats such as kelp forests, encrusting red algae, corals, and seagrass beds, as well as alternative degradation states of these habitats (i.e. branching coral vs. turf algae). Out of the 6,554 transects classified, 5,122 were sampled in Australian waters, which are the focus of this study. Not that this classification methodology excludes certain observations considered as noisy. Thus, from this dataset, we removed all transects classified as “noisy” (935 transects) while also removing transects for which at least one covariate had missing value due to the immediate proximity of the coastline (871 transects). Thus, the following analyses are based on 3,316 transects. As our goal in this study is to understand the distribution of biogenic habitats, we merged three out of the 17 initial habitat states (i.e. “Unconsolidated substrat”, “Bare substrat” and “Sand”) into a single group that corresponds to non-living substrate (“Substrate” hereafter). In addition, since turf algae can trap sediments and produce chemical substances preventing the recruitment of canopy-forming species [@Burek_2018], we decided to merge the initial group “Sand and Turf algae” with the group “Turf algae”. Overall, 14 reef states are modelled in this study (See appendix A, Table S1 for their description and Fig. S1 for their distribution across the dataset).

### Predictors dataset

The predictors used for model fitting were extracted from two sources: *Bio-Oracle* [@Assis_2018] for biophysical predictors and *Ocean Health Index* [@Halpern_2019] for anthropogenic pressures. *Bio-Oracle* provides aggregated data for the period 2000-2014 at a resolution of 0.083° (9.28 km at the equator). From this database, we extracted the mean values of four biophysical predictors known to be important for coastal ecosystems (@tbl:chap3tbl1).

The Ocean Health Index database provides yearly estimates for 14 predictors for the period 2003-2013 at a resolution of 0.0083° (928 m at the equator). We extracted yearly data for the eight predictors known to impact coastal ecosystems and computed the mean for all predictors. We also computed the standard deviation for the predictors linked to fishing activity (i.e. Artisanal fishing, Fishing High and Low Bycatch, Fishing Non-Destructive High and low Bycatch) . We then performed a principal component analysis on all predictors related to fisheries so as to synthesise the core information related to fishing impacts. The first two axes explained 44.3% and 21.3% of the variability, respectively. The first axis mostly describes variation in the intensity of destructive fishing activity for marine benthic habitats, whereas the second axis is related to non-destructive fishing activity (See Fig. S2 appendix A). In addition, we ensured that the selected predictors were not too highly correlated with each other (all absolute values of Pearson’s correlations < 0.7 ; Fig. S3 in appendix A).

Since the *Bio-Oracle* and *Ocean Health Index* datasets have different resolutions and projections, all predictors were reprojected to a common projection (EPSG:4326) and a common resolution of 0.0083°, which is the highest resolution offered by *Ocean Health Index*. Hence, bio-oracle predictors were downscaled to match the *Ocean Health Indices* resolution.

## Statistical analyses

### Model fitting and evaluation

We modelled habitat states using a multivariate Random Forest model [@Breiman_2001] fitted using the Python library Scikit-Learn [@scikit-learn]. The Random Forest model was trained on 163,800 combinations of hyperparameters “*max_depth*”, “*max_features*”, and “*n_estimators*” (see Table S2 in appendix B). For each combination of hyperparameters, we binarised the probabilities obtained from the Random Forest model according to reef state-specific thresholds that maximized the True Skill Statistic (MaxTSS ; @Allouche_2006), and only retained combination of hyperparameters having the highest MaxTSS on the explanatory folds (see below for the train/test split of the dataset).

To address the proximity of some transects and the resulting spatial autocorrelation, we used a 3-fold cross-validation procedure with spatial blocks for model training. Using the *blockCV* R package [@Valavi_2019], the autocorrelation range of the presences and absences between the different habitats states was estimated as 524 km$^2$, which was then used to split our study area into 37 blocks of that size (equal area across blocks) to ensure that the spatial correlation between any two blocks was negligible. Finally, each block and all the transects it contains were randomly assigned into three folds. This whole procedure ensured that spatially close transects were not used to both train and validate the model (See Fig S5. in appendix A). Using this method, we allocated the 3,316 transects into three folds that were used for training (and assessing explanatory power) as well as for estimating predictive power (training with two folds to predict the remaining one, in a classical cross-validation scheme). The distribution of different habitat states within the different training and test folds is presented in Fig S6 in appendix A.

The performance of explanatory power and predictive power were evaluated using a set of complementary metrics including the maximum of the True Skill Statistic (Max TSS) [@Allouche_2006], the F1-score, the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) [@Flach_2015] and the AUC [@Fawcett_2006]. Because model predictive power was poor,  tThe best hyperparameter combination based on explanatory power was then used to fit the model on the whole dataset.

### Model predictions

The most important variables in explaining the distribution of each reef habitat state were identified using the *SHAP* (*SHapley Additive exPlanations*) framework [@Lundberg_2017].  is a framework rooted in cooperative game theory [@Shapley_1953] that quantifies the contribution of each predictor to model predictions [@Lundberg_2017]. *SHAP* values were then averaged across states to identify the three most important variables across all states. Then, for each habitat state, we modelled their dependence against these three most influential variables using Partial Dependence Plots (i.e. marginal response curves; @Molnar_2022) across the observed range of our predictors.

Then, we investigated whether certain environmental conditions could be suitable for multiple habitats. To this end, we used the threshold that maximised the TSS for each habitat state during the hypertunning of the parameters of the Random Forest model (Fig. S7), to binarise occurrence probabilities into presences and absences. We then stacked these binary predictions across habitats to compute the number of states predicted as present in each pixel/set of environmental conditions. As performed for individual reef states, we explored the response of this number of predicted states against the three most influential variables, identified above, using Partial Dependence Plots.

From the stacked predictions, we also identified the habitat states that can co-occur in the same transect. We calculated the relative frequency with which each habitat state was associated with zero, one, two or more of the other habitat states. In order to study the spatial distribution of the number of predicted habitat states, we further calculated the minimal, median and maximum number of habitat states per spatial block. That scale was chosen since spatial blocks were built to be uncorrelated (and therefore independent) spatial units. Using a linear regression, we then investigated whether these spatial summary statistics varied depending on the coordinates of the spatial blocks (using the centroid of the block), and the number of transects within each spatial block. Quadratic effects were included for the latitude and longitude of the spatial blocks in order to account for potential non-linear effects.

## Results {#results-chapt3}

## Model Performance & Predictors importance

The models with the selected hyperparameters showed good explanatory power (measured on the fold on which the model was trained) with an average Max TSS across all habitat states of 0.78 ± 0.03 (mean ± standard deviation; Fig. S6 in appendix B). AUC values ranged from 0.89 to 0.99 (Fig. S8-21 in appendix B), while AUPRC values ranged from 0.48 to 0.71 (Fig. S22-35). The best explanatory power according to maxTSS was obtained for “Soft coral and gorgonians” ($\text{TSS}=0.94$), while the worst was obtained for “Turf” ($\text{TSS}=0.49$). The predictive power (calculated on the fold not used for model training) was significantly worse, with a mean Max TSS of 0.13 ± 0.04 (mean ± standard deviation). 

Our results show that habitat states usually respond to a set of weak predictors (i.e. most predictors contributed similarly to the explanatory power, although with some slight differences; @fig:chap3fig1). The three most important variables were Sea Surface Temperature, Fishing PC1 and Marine Heatwave anomalies (see Fig. S36-50 in appendix C). Although these three variables were the most important considering all habitats, the occurrence of certain habitats was best predicted by other covariates. For example, Primary Productivity appeared as a relevant predictor of Crustose coralline algae distribution, whereas Current Velocity was important for both Filamentous algae (Fig. S42 in appendix C), and Seagrass (Fig. S47. in appendix C). Overall, Direct Human Disturbance had a low explanatory power for all habitat states.

## Habitat states patterns

Overall, stacking predictions showed that most conditions are suitable to multiple habitat states, with a richness (i.e. number of predicted reef states for a given set of environmental conditions) of 3.43 ± 1.50 (mean ± standard deviation) ranging from one to eight potential habitat states occurring per transect. The richness varied differently along environmental gradients (@fig:chap3fig2 a): for instance, large variations around an average value of 4 were observed for Sea Surface Temperature whereas a global (non-linear) decrease was observed when fishing pressure or Marine heat-wave anomalies increased. 

Changes in habitat state richness along environmental gradients depends on the response of the 14 reef habitat states along these gradients (@fig:chap3fig2 b). Indeed, the relative stability of habitat state richness along the mean temperature gradient does not reflect a stability in the response of the different states but rather that some states are replacing others at certain temperature values. For instance, when Sea Surface Temperature exceeds 20°C, the model predicts a strong decrease in the probability of occurrence of Canopy Forming algae and Bushy Fucoid states but an increase in the probability of states dominated by Crustose coralline algae with and without Turf and by Green calcified algae. A bove that same 20°C threshold, the probability of occurrence of the Turf state is maximal. With regards to fishing pressure, the probability of occurrence of Turf is highest in areas that are less fished whereas the probability of occurrence of Large canopy forming algae increases with fishing pressure. For Marine Heatwaves, while the probability of occurrence Green calcified algae decreases as the frequency of Marine Heatwaves increases, the opposite is observed for Bushy Fucoid like states.

For graphical representation, we only plot here the [0%; 90%] values of Fishing PC1, due to few positive extreme values.](03-Chapitre3/figures/08-pdp_shap_env_richness.png){#fig:chap3fig2}

Among the 3,316 transects analysed, 222 (~6.5%) are predicted to be only suitable to a single habitat state while 71% exhibit favourable conditions to accommodate two to four different habitat states (@fig:chap3fig3 a). Out of the 16,384 possible combinations of occurrence and co-occurrence of the 14 habitat states, we predict only 302 (~2%) combinations of co-occurring habitat states. Among these combinations, 12 comprised one habitat state (note that Brown algae as well as Soft coral and gorgonians were never predicted to occur alone), while a maximum of 112 combinations were observed in transects predicted to be suitable for three different habitat states.
        
Interestingly, some reef habitat states (e.g. Turf or Large canopy forming algae) are more likely to occur in conditions suitable for only a few habitat states (one or two habitat states) while others (e.g. Filamentous algae, Red algae, Brown algae and Other Sessile invertebrates) are more likely to occur in conditions supposedly favourable to a large number of habitat states (@fig:chap3fig3 b).

Futher, our results indicate a preferential association between certain habitat states (@fig:chap3fig3 c). For instance, some iconic reef habitat states such as Branching coral are mainly predicted in areas that are also favourable to Turf (19% of the time) and Large Canopy Forming algae (14%). Other reef states such as Bushy Fucoidlike are mainly associated with Large canopy forming algae (15%), Turf (12%), Substrate (11%), and Filamentous algae (11%).

## Spatial distribution

At the Australian geographical scale, different spatial patterns of richness (i.e. number of predicted reef states) were observed depending on the region (@fig:chap3fig4). Most spatial blocks around Australia have transects where only one unique habitat state can occur (@fig:chap3fig4 a). The majority of spatial blocks have a median richness of 3 (@fig:chap3fig4 b). One has a richness of 6, but the number of transects in this spatial block is relatively low, with only seven transects sampled. On the east coast of Australia, in the Tweed-Moreton and Manning-Hawkesbury ecoregions, two ecoregions at the transition between temperate and tropical zones, the max richness was 8 whereas the median value of the adjacent temperate or tropical zones was lower. Over 73% of spatial blocks can accommodate up to seven or eight different reef habitat states (@fig:chap3fig4 c). Only the maximum of predicted reef states showed a significant relationship, albeit weak (linear coefficient of 0.007), with the number of transects carried out ($p<0.01$).

## Discussion {#discussion-chapt3}


In this study, we built upon Chapter 2 to explain and predict the spatial distribution of multiple reef benthic habitats. Overall, the random forest multivariate modelling approach we have used showed substantial explanatory power but a low predictive power, suggesting poor transferability. Despite evidence for a good explanatory power, all predictors presented a similar contribution to the variance explained precluding us to clearly identify the drivers of the spatial distribution of most habitats. Partial dependence plots highlighted some meaningful relationships and showed a differential response of habitats along environmental gradients that may ultimately trigger the emergence of alternative stable states. Importantly, some environmental conditions appeared to be suitable for several habitats suggesting that the current existence of an habitat in a given area may be due to historical contingencies and/or biotic settings.

## Explanatory and predictive power of the model     

Our model demonstrates some explanatory power, especially when it comes to elucidating the distribution of the rarest habitat states in the dataset such as Branching coral or Soft coral and gorgonians (See Fig. S1 in appendix A and Fig. S6 in appendix B). This outcome suggests that the model is able to decipher the complex relationships between environmental factors and habitat states. This strongly contrasts with the model’s predictive power, which is quite low overall. Several factors may contribute to the low transferability of the models. First, the reef habitat states defined in Chapter 2 are derived from cover data of about 50 substratum types and functional groups, defined according to the CATAMI benthic imagery classification scheme (@Althaus_2015 ; for further details, see @Edgar_2020). Hence, the initial reef state categorisation is based on cover data of morpho-types that does not take into account the identity of the underlying species. As a result, some reef states may have large environmental niches in our model while they are in fact driven by species with much narrower niches and located in different areas. For example, the diversity of Crustose coralline algae is estimated at several hundred different species [@Dean_2015; @Twist_2019], which can be found in both temperate and tropical zones [@Sissini_2022]. The same goes for Turf, which is a rather loosely defined functional group [@Connell_2014]. Turf can include nearly a hundred different species, sometimes with a lack of consistency in its definition across space [@Connell_2014]. Hence, while Turf can be found in both tropical and temperate zones, the underlying species and their ecology may greatly differ across different areas [@Filbee-Dexter_2018]. The absence of species-specific data may have implications for the model's low predictive power. It's worth noting that functional groups, given their occupation of distinct ecological niches, demonstrate variability across environmental large gradient, and thus are usefull units to study ecosystems functionning [@Benedetti_2018]. Furthermore, it's empirically observed that benthic assemblages exhibit more reliable and quantifiable spatial patterns compared to fish assemblages. This distinction has considerable implications when it comes to delineating appropriate management zones [@Sandin_2022].

Furthermore, discrepancies in predictor resolutions and misalignment with habitat states pose additional hurdles [@Potter_2013]. Our environmental dataset operates at best at a resolution of 1 km$^2$, while the photo quadrats from *RLS* transects, cover an approximate area of 20 m$^2$. This spatial disparity hampers the models to make accurate predictions [@Connor_2018 ; @Moudry_2023], the estimation of environment-species relationships may be flattenned [@Mourguiart_nd], resulting in an incorrect estimation of environmental niches. Variability of sampling effort per spatial block and differences in habitat states prevalence could be another potential explanatory factor for the model’s limited predictive power. Variations in data collection intensity across different spatial blocks or habitats could introduce bias and affect the MaxTSS threshold and thus model prediction performances [@Somodi_2017 ; @Leroy_2018]. However, it is unlikely that our predictive performances were particularly affected by the choice of metrics, since for the others the predictive power was also very low. Finaly, prevalence issues in sampling data hampered our predictive power in two ways. Firstly, The most prevalent groups are more prevalent by orders of magnitude. Turf, Canopy forming algae, Fucoid like algae represent respectively 24%, 17% and 13%, comparatively to Brown algae, Branching coral and Soft cora and gorgonians that represent only 2% and 1% each for the last two in the whole dataset (Fig. S1).

In light of these challenges, it is important to recognise that while our model apparently performs well in explaining the distribution of habitat states, its practical utility for making precise predictions is rather limited. Nonetheless, there are strategies for enhancing predictive power, such as improving predictor resolution to be closer to the scale at which transects are sampled, increasing sampling in the less well sampled spatial block, or the use of machine learning techniques to over-sample less prevalent habitats or under-sample more prevalent ones [@He_2009]. This latter strategy has not been applied in this study, due to the complexity of implementing it in conjunction with block-spatial structuring.. All the avenues presented here could be used to improve the predictive power of this type of model, in order to project the distribution of habitat states over the entire coastline. 

## Influence of biophysical factors and anthropogenic pressures

The most important variables identified for the different habitat states were, in order, Sea Surface Temperature, Fishing PC1 and Marine Heatwaves Anaomaly. Conversely, the variables manifesting the least influence across all habitat states were anthropogenic pressures, specifically Nutrient Pollution and Direct Human Disturbance. Our findings align with those of @Jouffray_2019, yet it is crucial to acknowledge a limitation that both our study and theirs share. Certain anthropogenic pressures, such as Nutrient Pollution, can be highly localized, posing challenges for regional models to accurately capture. Consistent with the observations of @Jouffray_2019, our model underscores the critical role of Sea Surface Temperature in shaping habitat states. This aligns with previous literature emphasizing temperature's significance in predicting benthic diversity patterns, as evidenced by @Belanger_2012.

Response curves provide insights into the relationships between environmental factors and certain habitat states. Overall, the response curves we have generated exhibit a commendable degree of consistency with the existing literature. For instance, we confirm that Filamentous algae tend to thrive in areas less exposed to marine currents [@Quintano_2015], while Branching coral are more prevalent in warm temperate waters [@Higuchi_2015]. These patterns provide valuable ecological insights and corroborate our understanding of the response of these habitats along environmental gradients. However, it is important to recognise that not all relationships exhibit such consistency. Notably, the positive link between fishing pressure or marine heatwaves and the prevalence of Large canopy forming algae, is less straightforward and even seems contradictory. It is crucial to contextualise these findings within the framework of our modelling approach. The SDM model employed in this study is correlative by essence [@Shabani_2016], only capturing statistical associations between environmental variables and habitat states. While these correlations can reveal important ecological patterns, they do not establish causal relationships. Understanding the drivers behind these relationships requires a nuanced perspective. For example, the observed positive correlation between Large canopy forming algae and commercial fishing activity may be the result of the high fishing commercial value of kelp forests, where approximately $30,000 of fish products are extracted per hectare and per year [@Eger_2023]. Similarly, the relationship between marine heatwaves and the probability of occurrence of Large canopy forming algae should be interpreted in the context of ecological dynamics that Australian shores recently experienced. Indeed, major episodes of marine heatwaves occurred in 2011 and 2015 (Hobday et al. 2018) that have led to the decline of kelp, a common large canopy-forming species, in the following years [@Wernberg_2016]. This may lead to a spurious correlation in our dataset, since transect may have been sampled in these areas before the kelps disappeared. Furthermore, Large Canopy Forming algae contains more than just temperate macroalgae, some species of tropical fleshy macroalgae such as Sargassum spp. have been incorporated as Large canopy forming categories. This kind of fleshy macroalgue can be found growing on the top of coral reef after a regime shift to a macroalgae dominated reef [@Smith_2022], especially if the coral reef has been degraded due to marine heatwaves [@Donovan_2021].

## Co-occurrence patterns

Our exploration of co-occurrence patterns among reef habitat states has yielded intriguing findings shedding light on the ecological dynamics of these underwater ecosystems. It’s striking to note that only a mere 2% of the possible combinations among the 14 habitat states were observed in our data. This limited co-occurrence of habitat states within transects suggests a complex interplay of ecological factors governing their distribution. Certain habitat states exhibit weak co-occurrence patterns with others, implying distinct environmental responses or the ability for these states to thrive in inhospitable conditions. For instance, Branching coral and Soft corals and gorgonians rarely co-occur (@fig:chap3fig3 c.), this can be explain by the small number of corals habitats states in our dataset (see Discussion in Chapter 2). It can also be a manifestation of niche differences between the two differents groups, although competition between these two groups may also contribute to this pattern [Sammarco_1983].

Another interesting observation concerns Large canopy forming algae, and Turf that are frequently predicted alone. While this pattern could be the result of a bias in our model where the differential prevalence of habitat states combined with the variable number of transects per spatial block could influence the joint occurrence probabilities predicted by the model in each observational unit, an ecological explanation is also possible. Specifically, we found that other habitat types presenting similar characteristics with wide ecological niches and a high prevalence (e.g. Bushy Fucoid-like, Crustose coralline algae; Fig. S1 in appendix A) do not exhibit similar patterns (@fig:chap3fig3 b.), this observation suggests that the influence of the this bias may be less pronounced than initially perceived, indicating the potential involvement of other underlying factors. Thus, the underlying reasons explaining why Turf and Large canopy forming algae are frequently found alone are likely different. For Turf it may be due to areas that have already undergone a regime shift (i.e. the original habitat has disappeared and has been replaced by Turf; @Jouffray_2015), regime shift that struck hundreds of kilometres of Australian coastline [@Filbee-Dexter_2018]. For Large canopy forming algae, it may be due to a bias in the *RLS* sampling method, which, with its photoquadrat, does not take into account understory habitat, such as Red algae, Brown algae and Crustose coralline algae, thus underestmating the niche of the low-profile understory habitat states.

## Richness Spatial Patterns

Our examination of spatial richness patterns within spatial-blocks has unveiled insights into the distribution of habitat states along the Australian coast. This analysis raises important questions about the ecological significance of these patterns and their potential implications for the region’s marine ecosystems. One notable observation is that the majority of spatial-blocks predominantly exhibit a single ecological status. This phenomenon highlights the prevalence of specific habitat types in various regions, which can be either desirable, such as areas characterised by Large canopy forming, Bushy Fucoid like, or seagrass [@Coleman_2017 ; @Filbee-Dexter_2018 ; @Janes_2021], or less desirable, such as those dominated by Turf [@Filbee-Dexter_2018]. This raises an intriguing question: do these unique habitat states persist in areas that have remained largely unaffected by regime shifts, or do they represent remnants of past ecological transformations? Understanding the historical context and ecological drivers behind these spatial patterns is crucial to unravelling their significance.

Intriguingly, the eastern Australian transition zone stands out with a greater median habitat diversity. This may be linked to the ongoing process of tropicalisation occurring in the region [@Figueira_2010]. As the climate warms, there is increasing evidence of shifts in marine ecosystems, including the expansion of tropical species into temperate zones [@Verges_2014]. This phenomenon could potentially lead to regime shifts in the near future [@Verges_2019], making the eastern Australian transition zone a focal point for monitoring and research. Furthermore, it’s worth noting that a substantial number of spatial blocks exhibit the maximum number of habitat states. This intriguing finding suggests the possibility of ongoing or impending state changes across the entire Australian coast.

An important question regarding the spatial pattern in the number of predicted reef states observed in this study is the ecological relevance of the unit used: the block-spatial unit. Although it is a spatial unit rarely used in ecology, contrary to pixels, this spatial unit makes it possible to minimise the autocorrelation between different types of habitat state [@Valavi_2019]. This is why, in the case of this study, richness seems to be independent of the latitude or longitude position of the spatial-blocks. In addition, this spatial unit allows us to adjust for certain sampling biases. For example, it allows us to take into account that some 1 km$^2$ pixels will have many transects, while others relatively close by will have no transects at all, as they may not be dive sites accessible by *RLS* volunteers. Thus, from a pratical point of view, in the case of unbalanced sampling desing, this artificial unit still represents an interesting observation unit for studying diversity on the scale of a large region such as Australia.

## Conclusion {#conclu-chapt3}

Our study delves into the spatial distribution of multiple reef benthic habitats and aims to point to some areas that are more prone to regime shifts based on environmental niche similarities. Yet while our model provides some insights in explaining the distribution of habitat states and its associated ecological drivers, its predictive power appeared limited for several reasons including resolution mismatch between response and predictor variables or the way habitats were clustered. Despite these limits, which are mostly tailored to the datasets used, this approach could prove useful to identify the conditions under which multiple habitats can be found, and therefore the areas where regime shifts are more likely to take place.
