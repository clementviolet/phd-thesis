![Map of the sampled sites. Point shapes vary according to their contribution to model training set (circles ; used to evaluate model explanatory power) as opposed to the two sites retained for independent model testing (triangles ; used to evaluate model predictive power). Point colours vary according to the presence or absence of the two habitats in each site. The two test sites include the two habitats (i.e. seagrass and bare sand) and were chosen because they occur in environmental conditions that can be considered average at the scale of the region (thereby limiting extrapolation of the model) but still harbour different communities, representative of the known diversity gradient across the region.](03-Chapitre1/figures/supplementary/fig_supp1.png){#fig:chapt1supp1}

![Fuzzy PCA of the species-by-trait matrix. The first three axes represent 58.55% of the total variance. The first axis distinguishes sessile microphagous species (top positive values) from mobile macrophagous predatory species (bottom negative values). The second axis is a gradient of reproductive strategies (semelparous vs iteroparous). The third axis distinguishes burrowers with direct development from tube-dwellers with planktonic development. For abbreviations and meaning of the trait modalities, see @Boye_2019a.](03-Chapitre1/figures/supplementary/fig_supp2.png){#fig:chapt1supp2}

## Environmental data acquisition {.unnumbered .unlisted}

The models used in this study incorporate a dataset consisting of seven environmental variables related to oceanography, hydrography, and granulometry obtained from @Boye_2019b The oceanographic variables include the standard deviation of salinity, surface water temperature, mean velocity of currents, and fetch, which were obtained from the PREVIMER database [@Lecornu_2009] based on the MARS3D model [@Lazure_2008]. The variables were averaged by extracting daily data for the sampled year at the site coordinates and the eight adjacent cells. The fetch was calculated as the average length of nine radiating fetch segments with a maximum distance of 300km. The granulometry variables were derived from sediment cores that were taken along with associated fauna. The cores were dried, separated into 15 fractions, and the Trask index was calculated as the ratio of the 25th to 75th percentile of the grain distribution. Organic matter mass was estimated through the loss of mass after combustion in an oven.
